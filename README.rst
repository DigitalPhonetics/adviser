Installation
============

Downloading the code
--------------------

If you are not familiar with `Git`, just download the zip file available in the ``Clone or Download``. Then unzip and enter the main folder.


Cloning the repository
-----------------------

If you feel comfortable with `Git`, you may instead clone the repository.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/adviser.git


Install requirements with pip
------------------------------

ADvISER needs to be executed in a Python3 environment.

Once you have the code locally navigate to the top level directory, where you will find the file
`requirements.txt`, which lists all modules you need to run ADvISER. We suggest to create a
virtual environment from the top level directory, as shown below, followed by installing the necessary packages.


1. (You need to have pip, or pip3) Make sure you have virtualenv installed by executing

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

2. Create the virtual environment (replace envname with a name of your choice)

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv <path-to-env>

3. Source the environment (this has to be repeated every time you want to use ADVISER inside a
new terminal session)

.. code-block:: bash

    source <path-to-env>/bin/activate

4. Navigate to the adviser folder

.. code-block:: bash

    cd adviser

5. Install the required packages

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

and, to make sure your installation is working, execute

.. code-block:: bash

    python run_chat.py --domain courses

6. Select a language by entering `english` or `german`, then chat with ADvISER. To end your
conversation, type `bye`.
