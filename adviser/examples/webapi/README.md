# Purpose

ADVISER's web API examples show you how you can use ADVISER without databases but with APIs as information source. As examples we provide the weather domain which uses the API from `api.openweathermap.org` and the mensa domain which uses calls to a mensa's website which belongs to the University of Stuttgart.
