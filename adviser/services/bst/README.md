# Purpose:
The code in the bst folder is related to tracking information the user provides throughout the dialog. Currently this is done with a rules-based approach.

# File Descriptions:
* `bst.py`: Defines a `HandcraftedBST` class which provides a rules-based belief state tracker (BST) which can be accessed like a dictionary and is built up as the user provides more information.
