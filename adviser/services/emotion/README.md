# Purpose:
The emotion folder contains code for emotion recognition. Currently it is implemented for acoustic features only (gemaps feature set extracted with openSMILE), however this could be expanded to multimodal processing in the future.

# File Descriptions:
* `EmotionRecognition.py`: Defines a class for (uni- or multimodal) emotion recognition.
* `test_gemaps_feats.npy`: gemaps feature vector of one utterance for testing purposes.
