    Decorator function for services.
    To be able to publish / subscribe to / from topics,

        * at least one message is received for each topic in sub_topics (only latest message will be forwarded, others dropped)
        * at least one message is received for each topic in queued_sub_topics (all messages since the previous function call will be forwarded as a list)

    Args:
        sub_topics(List[str or utils.topics.Topic]): The topics you want to get the latest messages from.
                                                     If multiple messages are received until your function is called,

        queued_sub_topics(List[str or utils.topics.Topic]): The topics you want to get all messages from.
                                                            If multiple messages are received until your function is called,

    Notes:
        * Subscription topic names have to match your function keywords
        * Your function should return a dictionary with the keys matching your publish topics names 
          and the value being any arbitrary python object or primitive type you want to send
        * sub_topics and queued_sub_topics have to be disjoint!
        * If you need timestamps for your messages, specify a 'timestamps' argument in your subscribing function.
          It will be filled by a dictionary providing timestamps for each received value, indexed by name.
    
    Technical notes:
        * Data will be automatically pickled / unpickled during send / receive to reduce meassage size.
          However, some python objects are not serializable (e.g. database connections) for good reasons
          and will throw an error if you try to publish them.
        * The domain name of your service class will be appended to your publish topics.
          Subscription topics are prefix-matched, so you will receive all messages from 'topic/suffix'
          if you subscibe to 'topic'.
